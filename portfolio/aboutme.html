              <h2> History</h2>
                <p>I was born and raised just outside of Chicago. Cold winters made me decide that warmer weather is where it's at so I moved to South Florida. Then after graduating college (and a few more years after) I moved to sunny Phoenix Arizona.
              <h2> Education</h2>
                <p>I graduated with a bachlors in anthropology with a focus on archaeology<p>
              <h2>Work History</h2>
                <p>I bounced around a bit after my short stint as a contract archaeologist. I started off working in the manufacturing field but found it wasn't for me. I finally found my home in the kitchen. I started off savory but transitioned into pastry and never looked back.Eventually, to make ends meet, I found myself behind the bar which combined my creativity with customer service.
                </p>
              <h2> Hobbies</h2>
                <p> One of my favorite hobbies,and one that im quite good at, is art. Another is electronic repair.
